# Hangman Game
 A Python implementation of the classic "Hangman" game. The player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word from a random list. The game provides visual feedback through stages, showing the playerâ€™s remaining lives as they make incorrect guesses. The game ends when the player either guesses the word or loses all lives.
